  <h1>Bug Reports, Suggestions, and Info!</h1>
  <b>Reporting a Bug</b>
  <p>If you find a bug, which is honestly quite likley, please do the following.</p>

  <p>  
    1. Right click the page and click "inspect". A new page will open up. <br>
    2. Click "Console". Doing so will reveal all errors from the code. <br>
    3. Send me a screenshot of the console errors, as well as a detailed report of what the bug is and what is required to reproduce it. </p>
  <p>Please reach me through the following email: <br>simplewebchat.swc@gmail.com</p>

  <b>Sending a suggestion</b>
  <p>Suggestions should be sent to the same email: <br>simplewebchat.swc@gmail.com</p>

  <p>I will try to reply to (and maybe, if the idea is good) impliment these within a few days. I'd really like to polish this project and it's UI. If you have an idea that will overhaul a huge amount of code or only very minorly convenience the user, I will probably not impliment it. </p>

  <b>Technical Information</b>
  <p>All of the backend data for this project is stored on a firebase realtime database. I did this because 1. it's free and 2. it's quite a bit easier to use than creating my own backend from scratch. All of the data, besides passcodes, is stored unencrypted on this database. There are read and write permission systems in place based on firebase auth.</p>
  <p>I don't trust myself to not mess up security, so I do not allow the user to choose their own passcode. Everyone would probably use the same passcode they use for every other account they own, and if I mess up and these passcodes are somehow aquired by a malicious third party, it would be bad. Very bad.</p>
  <p>There is no reason any passcodes should be leaked because they are hashed before they even make it to the server. BUT. The messages are not encrypted, and the read/write permissions are not watertight. There is probably some exploit I didn't think of that would allow people to read messages in chats they aren't a part of. So please, do not share your deepest darkest secrets over this platform. Assume it could be read by someone else.</p>
