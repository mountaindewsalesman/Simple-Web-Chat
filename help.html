  <h1>Bug Reports, Suggestions, and Info!</h1>
  <h3>Reporting a Bug</h3>
  <p>If you find a bug, which is honestly quite likley, please do the following.</p>

  <p>  
    1. Right click the page and click "inspect". A new page will open up. <br>
    2. Click "Console". Doing so will reveal all errors from the code. <br>
    3. Send me a screenshot of the console errors, as well as a detailed report of what the bug is and what is required to reproduce it. </p>
  <p>Please reach me through the following email: <br>simplewebchat.swc@gmail.com</p>

  <h3>Sending a suggestion</h3>
  <p>Suggestions should be sent to the same email: <br>simplewebchat.swc@gmail.com</p>

  <p>I will try to reply to (and maybe, if the idea is good) impliment these within a few days. I'd really like to polish this project and it's UI. If you have an idea that will overhaul a huge amount of code or only very minorly convenience the user, I will probably not impliment it. </p>

  <h3>Technical Information</h3>

  On the off chance you care or are curious about the inner workings of this project, read here. 
  <p>All of the backend data for this project is stored on a firebase realtime database. I did this because 1. it's free to start and 2. it's quite a bit easier to use than creating my own backend from scratch. All of the data, besides passcodes, is stored unencrypted on this database. There are read and write permission systems in place based on firebase auth.</p>
  <p>I don't trust myself to not mess up security, so I do not allow the user to choose their own passcode. Everyone would probably use the same passcode they use for every other account they own, and if I mess up and these passcodes are somehow aquired by a malicious third party, it would be bad. Very bad.</p>
  <p>There is no reason any passcodes should be leaked because they are hashed before they even make it to the server. BUT. The messages are not encrypted, and the read/write permissions are not watertight. There is probably some exploit I didn't think of that would allow people to read messages in chats they aren't a part of. So please, do not share your deepest darkest secrets over this platform. Assume it could be read by someone else.</p>
  <p>Every message is stored in a class with properties timeCreated, Content, Type, and Author. Author lets the messages say like "Mountain Man: This is a message", type lets me differentiate in rendering text and images and other types, content is the content, and time created allows for notifications that persist across sessions. The timestamp of the last seen message for each chat for each user is stored in the database, and if the most recent message's timestamp is after that, there must be unread content in the chat. </p>
  <p>Images are sent using base64 encoding. This means images are converted into text which is sent like a normal text message, which is then uploaded to the database, opened for all clients, and decoded. Because images are stored as text in the database, and not as a reference to another database containing images, (an arguably better approach that would cut down on lag, but one which would require me to rewrite all the security permissions), images must be compressed as much as possible before being sent. This prevents massive lag. Images are compressed down to (50kb?) before being sent.</p>
  <p>This is especially important because, as of now, the entire contents of each chat are loaded for every message sent or received. Yes, this is really inefficient, but the contents of the chat are small enough that it hasn't arisen any problems yet, and I'm too lazy to fix it. If a chat has tons and tons of images, you might notice a slightly annoying delay when sending messages, but other than that I think it's fine. This is probably fine because each chat is limited to only 80 messages (after which the oldest messages get deleted), except for the global chat which is limited to 150.</p>
  <p>I really don't claim to have perfect or even good and well optimized code, but what matters to me is that it works, and it's reliable and secure and easy to use. Nothing questionable behind the scenes seems to harm any of these goals.</p>
